# 📊 Data Visualization – Business Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights** virtual experience program on **Forage**.  
Forage partners with leading companies to provide free, open-access job simulations that let students and early-career professionals experience real workplace tasks.  

In this program, Tata provided a simulated business case where I worked with **retail transaction data** to derive insights, design dashboards, and communicate findings for executive decision-making.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed raw retail transaction data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).  
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards**: Built interactive dashboards in Tableau to answer business questions.  
- 💡 **Business Insights**: Focused on analyzing sales trends, customer segmentation, geographical demand, and product performance.  
- 🌐 **Virtual Internship**: Completed through Tata Group’s Virtual Job Simulation on the Forage platform.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Businesses generate vast amounts of data but often struggle to extract meaningful insights.  
This project bridges the gap between **raw data** and **actionable intelligence** by applying effective **data visualization techniques** to a real retail dataset.

---

## 🚀 Goals
1. 🔍 Explore business scenarios and identify key questions.  
2. 🧹 Clean, structure, and preprocess datasets for quality.  
3. 📈 Apply visualization techniques (line charts, bar charts, maps, dashboards).  
4. 🎙️ Communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.  
5. 📖 Emphasize **storytelling with data** to drive decisions.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is **`Online Retail.xlsx`**, containing over **500,000 transaction records**, including:  

- 🧾 Invoice details  
- 🏷️ Product codes & descriptions  
- 🔢 Quantities & unit prices  
- 👤 Customer IDs  
- 📅 Transaction dates  
- 🌍 Customer countries

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. 📥 **Data Acquisition** – Dataset provided in the simulation.  
2. 🧹 **Preprocessing** – Cleaned data, handled missing values, derived `Revenue = Quantity × UnitPrice`.  
3. 🔎 **EDA** – Explored trends & outliers using Python visualizations.  
4. 🖥️ **Visualization Design** – Built dashboards with Tableau for interactive analysis.  
5. 💡 **Insight Generation** – Translated visuals into meaningful business insights.  
6. ✅ **Validation** – Ensured clarity, relevance, and accuracy of dashboards.  
7. 🎥 **Presentation** – Presented findings in a concise, stakeholder-focused way.

## 📊 Dashboards Created
Four interactive dashboards were designed in **Tableau**:  

1. 📈 **Sales Trend Analysis (CEO – Q1)**: Monthly revenue for 2011, highlighting seasonal trends.  
2. 🌍 **Country-Wise Performance (CMO – Q2)**: Top 10 countries by revenue (excluding the UK).  
3. 👥 **Customer Segmentation (CMO – Q3)**: Top 10 customers by revenue, showing high-value clients.  
4. 🗺️ **Geographical Insights (CEO – Q4)**: Demand heatmap across countries (excluding the UK).

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/GPA95/Oneline_Retail_Data_Viz.git
    
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ``` bash
    cd Data-Visualization-Business-Insights
    
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies**:
    ``` bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly openpyxl
    
    ```
4.  **Open and run the Python script**:
      * The Python script (`.py` or `.ipynb`) used for data preprocessing and initial analysis can be found in the `scripts/` directory (or similar, depending on organization).
      * This script will clean the `Online Retail.xlsx` dataset and prepare it for Tableau.
5.  **Access Tableau Dashboards**:
      * Ensure you have Tableau Desktop installed.
      * Open the Tableau workbook file (`.twb` or `.twbx`) located in the `tableau/` directory (or similar).
      * Connect the dashboards to the cleaned dataset generated by the Python script.

## Future Scope

  * 📊 Add predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting with time-series models).
  * 🔄 Automate dashboard updates with real-time feeds.
  * 📆 Extend analysis to multi-year datasets.
  * 💰 Include KPIs like profit margins & customer lifetime value.
  * 🤖 Explore AI-driven insights in Tableau.
